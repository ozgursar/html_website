      <p>Flying rc models is not a cheap hobby. Before building your first model you will need a few items to get started.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Radio Transmitter</h3>
          <div class="list-details">
            <img src="../images/radio.jpg" alt="Radio transmitter" class="article-image" />
            <ul>
              <li>This is the first equipment you would need before buying any other stuff.</li>
              <li>You would use this radio transmitter to control all your models. It should be as high quality as possible.</li>
              <li>You need to buy receiver units compatible to your transmitter.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Battery and Battery Charger</h3>
          <div class="list-details">
            <img src="../images/battery-and-charger.jpg" alt="Battery for rc models and charger" class="article-image" />
            <ul>
              <li>Lipo batteries are used for powering electric powered rc models.</li>
              <li>You would need a few batteries when you go to the flying field.</li>
              <li>Your charger should be able to charge safely without damaging the battery's chemistry.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Nitro or Gas Fuel</h3>
          <div class="list-details">
            <img src="../images/fuel.jpg" alt="Nitro or gas fuel used for rc models" class="article-image" />
            <ul>
              <li>Not all models are electric powered. Especially larger models require fuel for their engines.</li>
              <li>RC engines work with nitromethane-alcohol mixture or gas.</li>
              <li>These fuels are highly flamable and poisionous. They should be carefully handled.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>RC Simulator</h3>
          <div class="list-details">
            <img src="../images/simulator.jpg" alt="RC simulator for computer" class="article-image" />
            <ul>
              <li>RC simulators that run on very similar to computer games help you develop required skills.</li>
              <li>It is a safe way to practice how model flies and gives you a feeeling before trying the real model.</li>
              <li>You can try risky moves before trying them on your actual model. It helps avoid crashes and saves you money!</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
