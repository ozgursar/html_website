        <p>Drones are getting very popular in this hobby and there are many different types from toys to professional filming equipment.</p>
        <p>FPV (first person view) flight is very different than LOS (line of sight) flight because you are seeing through the camera mounted on the drone!</p>

          <h3>Multirotor Drones</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Multirotor means there are multiple rotating propellers that provide upwards thrust.</li>
              <li>Most common ones are the quadcopters (drones with 4 props). These are widely use for aerial photography or racing.</li>
              <li>You would need soldering skills and basic electronic knowledge to assemble the motors, speed controllers, flight controller, video transmitter and camera.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fixed-wing Drones (FPV Planes)</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Planes are also used widely for FPV (first person view) flight.</li>
              <li>Usually these are electric motor planes built from foam to keep the model as light as possible.</li>
              <li>They offer longer flight times at higher altitudes.</li>
              <li>Video is transmitted through the camera to the pilot's goggles or monitor on the ground.</li>
              <li>Special radio transmitters are used for long range flights up to 40km!</li>
            </ul>
