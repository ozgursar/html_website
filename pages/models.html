        <p>Once you have the necessary equipment, you can finally decide what to fly.</p>
        <p>Planes are easier to learn and fly compared to helicopters. They both have distint thrills and enjoyment so I built both planes and helicopters.</p>
        <p>When you are new to the hobby, it is best to start with a cheap, trainer plane model. Once you develop some skills and experience you can move to expensive & complex models.</p>

            <h3>RC Planes</h3>

              <li>RC planes are usually sold as kits, which means that you need to assemble many parts.</li>
              <li>Kits do not include electronics, so you would need to choose and order a receiver, servos for control surfaces, motor or engine and several other equipment to wire them up.</li>
              <li>It takes patience and requires experience to build planes. You may watch youtube videos or get help from your frields when building your first plane!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>RC Helicopters</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Helicopters are also sold as unassembled kits.</li>
              <li>They are extremely dangerous due to high speed rotating blades. So, you should carefully follow the assembly manual and get help from friends for its initial setup.</li>
              <li>RC helicopters can fly upside down, do very complex maneuvers and offer ultimate thrill and enjoyment</li>
              <li>You must buy lots of spare parts because once you crash, it is almost impossible to repair broken parts and you need to replace them with new ones!</li>
