      <p>RC models are not toys! Before starting this hobby you need to know the dangers involved and follow best practices to avoid any harm or damage.</p>
      <p>Basic tips that should keep your flying experiences as safe and enjoyable as possible.</p>
      <h2>Guidelines</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Be aware of any model flying rules and regulations as set out by your country's governing body.</li>
        <li>Select your flying site carefully, and always check to see whether flying an rc aircraft is permitted in the area that you want to fly.</li>
        <li>Be very aware of proximity to houses, roads, schools etc. and keep as far away as possible. The larger and clearer the open space for radio control flying, the better.</li>
        <li>Fly within your skill limitations.</li>
        <li>Don't be shy to ask for help from experienced RC pilots</li>
      </ol>
